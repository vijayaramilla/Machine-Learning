# Machine-Learning
Various Classification algorithms to classify datasets from Finance, Bio, Vision, NLP and Speech data sets.
# Perceptron classification algorithm implementation.
Added code changes to implement perceptron algorithm. Code files include:
1. Training datasets related to various domains.
2. Perceptron algorithm framework.
3. Classify.py file to parse arguments and call the fit and predict methods.

Algorithm Description:
1. This algorithm uses sign function as model to predict.
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent is used to perform online training on each input.
3. Uses hinge loss function without hinge.
4. Implementation accepts user arguments for learning rates.
